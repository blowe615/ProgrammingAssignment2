## Functions to cache and retrieve the inverse of a matrix so that 
## repeated computations are not required

## Create a list of functions to set and get the matrix and
## set and get the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Calculate the inverse of matrix 'x' using the solve() function
## or retrieve the inverse from the cache if it has already been calculated

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
